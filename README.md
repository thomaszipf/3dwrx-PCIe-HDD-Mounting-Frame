I just upgraded my PC, so that there was a HDD in spare that I could pass to my son to enable him install more games :-)

So, there was not sufficient space in the HTPC he has, so I needed to find a solution while his PCI-E Slot was still not used (there were two).

So... I designed this thing. However, he has no SATA in spare, so I ended up not using it, but maybe you can feedback on this approach to let me know if everything is working out for you :-)

Happy to see ppl downloading and printing this thing :-)
